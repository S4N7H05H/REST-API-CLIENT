# Description

This task focuses on creating a Java application that consumes a public REST API and displays data in a structured, human-readable format. The project demonstrates how Java interacts with web services over the internet using HTTP requests and JSON parsing.

The application fetches real-time weather information from the Open-Meteo API, a free public API that provides forecast data without requiring an API key. It sends an HTTP GET request using classes such as URL, HttpURLConnection, and InputStreamReader, reads the JSON response, and extracts meaningful details such as temperature, wind speed, and observation time.

The JSON data is parsed using the org.json library, and the results are printed neatly on the console. The program also includes exception handling to manage network or input/output errors gracefully.

This task reinforces core Java concepts such as network programming, API integration, and JSON data handling. It provides practical experience in working with external data sources—an essential skill for modern software developers building web-enabled or data-driven applications.
